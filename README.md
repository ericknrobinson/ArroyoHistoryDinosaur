Data and code for Finley et al., In press (accepted 08-28-2022), Geoarchaeology: An International Joural, "Arroyo formation impacts on an early dryland agricultural community in northeastern Utah, USA"

This paper focuses on the history of arroyo formation during the occupation of Dinosaur National Monument by Fremont agriculturalists, AD 300-1300. This repository holds the radiocarbon data, associated stratigraphic information, and OxCal CQL code (Bronk Ramsey 2009) used to produce Bayesian chronological models of the timing of arroyo formation at two different 'Alluvial Localities' (Alluvial Locality 1 and Alluvial Locality 2) in Cub Creek. OxCal CQL code is provided for both models from Cub Creek Alluvial Locality 1.

This project reconstructs the sensitivity of alluvial valleys to precipitation change and arroyo development in the vicinity of a dryland farming community. This project provides comparative data for arroyo histories throughout the Colorado Plateau.

Users will need to download OxCal (https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) to run the CQL code. Users can reach out to the authors for further inquiries, help accessing the data, or running the code.

This project is maintained by Erick Robinson, Judson Finley, and Justin DeRose. This project is funded by the National Science Foundation (BCS: 2115151; "Hydroclimatic Variability and the Evolution of Socioecological Complexity in Dryland Farming Commuities")
